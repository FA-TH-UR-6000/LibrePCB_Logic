## Description

### Platform
LibrePCB library

1. John Eaton Ouabache DesignWorks   : Base logic gates (Probably more, can't tell after the new stuff was added)

### Installation:
https://librepcb.org/docs/quickstart/install-remote-libraries/

### Usage
Have fun and don't forget the decoupling capacitors.

### Additional
Logism and Digital (my beloved) are great logic simulation programs.
               I highly recommend them if you're interested in digital circuit design.
               Don Lancaster's and R.M. Marston's books are a great source of logic circuits and everything else.
              (Scout for Marston's books on eBay and other resellers, Amazon vendors are price-gouging hard)
